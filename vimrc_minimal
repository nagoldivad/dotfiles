" This is my minimal vanilla vim setup
" A lot of this was inspired by this article:

" ---- ---- ---- ----
"  Appearance

syntax enable       " enable syntax color
colorscheme molokai " colorscheme    

set number          " show line numbers
set showcmd         " shows last command in bottom left

" ---- ---- ---- ----
"  Spaces & Tabs

set tabstop=2       " number of visual spaces
set softtabstop=2   " number of spaces each tab equals
set expandtab       " makes tabs into spaces

set autoindent      " auto indentation

" ---- ---- ---- ----
" Find/Search

" Everything in this section came from:
" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA2WjJbmmoM&t=408s

" search into subdirectories recursively endlessly
set path+=**

" display all matching files when tab complete
set wildmenu
